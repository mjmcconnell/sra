        Why clay? Sharon loves the way it feels, the squidge of the wet clay,
        the stroking and caressing the clay, feeling for imaginary bones and muscles,
        then finally animating, bringing out the character/personality of my subjects.
        Clay is the perfect medium to convey the sense of strength yet fragility
        that is present in all her sculptures.

        It was only after a period of illness that Sharon explored sculpture.
        That illness, at the time, seemed like negative time in her life but actually
        opened the door to a much more fulfilling life.

        When out walking the dogs or exploring country lanes on horseback Sharon loves
        those special moments when she catches sight of a wild animal, it feels like a gift
        to see a hare watching me or foxes playing as the sun sets and I love to watch the
        horses playing in the field and showing off. My sculptures aim to capture that
        special moment and bring the outdoors indoors.
